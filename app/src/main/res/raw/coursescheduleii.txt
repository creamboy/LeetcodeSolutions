210.	Course Schedule II
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Solution

本题判断是否可以按序完成课程，可以把课程 (vertex) 和次序 (edge) 看成一个 directed graph，如果存在 cycle，则无法完成课程。根据 directed graph 的性质：没有 cycle 等同于该 graph 存在 topological order，所以本题即转化为判断是否存在 topological order (即课程完成次序)。
首先需要实现一个 Digraph 的 class，使用 adjacency lists: List<Integer>[] adj 存放 edges。
Topological sort 的实现有两种形式，可以用 DFS 或 BFS。本题是判断 topological order 是否存在，而不需要做 topological sort，所以 code 可稍简化。
