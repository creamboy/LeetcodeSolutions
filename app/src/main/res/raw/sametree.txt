100.	Same Tree
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not. Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Recursion: Time ~ O(N), Space ~ O(logN)

public class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p==null || q==null){
            return p==q;
        }
        return p.val==q.val && isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}}
